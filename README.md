# Projects of CS50w: Web Programming with Python and Javascript

## Project 0

Project 0 is a Google frontend clone. It has three html pages corresponding to
Google's primary search page, image search page and advanced search page. CSS
is used to style pages to look somewhat like Google's corresponding pages.
Forms use the real Google search as the action attribute. So the inputted
search queries are redirected to Google search.
